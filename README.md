# I am RearDoor

I like bending the rules without breaking them. Bending the rules as much as possible. 

I started creating exploits for Roblox. Mainly focused on aimbots and esps.

I then moved to browser automation for a chess bullet bot. Currently working on a duolingo 100x bot.

I am learning CV and openvino to try do some aimbots in aimlabs.
